# Spokerv2
Spoker v2 - refactored from the ground up using professional industry development experience. SpokerV2 is based on my original devCodeCamp Capstone project from 2020 called [Spoker.io](https://github.com/fmorrisey/Spoker.io). After 4 years of industry experience, it's long overdue for a refactoring from the ground up.
